							<p>My interest in acupuncture was ignited having personally experienced and benefited from treatment. I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to train at the College of Traditional Acupuncture, Royal Leamington Spa, with the internationally acclaimed <a href="https://worsleyinstitute.com/jr-worsley/">Professor J.R.Worsley</a>.</p>
							<p>Following qualification in 1996, I seized the opportunity of shadowing Professor JR Worsley during clinical consultations and went on to train with the Worsley Institute, joining the Masters Apprenticeship Program in Boston and Seattle. Post Graduate qualifications include basic teacher training at Red Feather Lakes, Colorado, USA (2016) and advanced teacher training at the Institute of Taoist Education and Acupuncture (ITEA), Louisville, Colorado, USA (2019). Current member of the <a href="https://worsleyinstitute.com/worsley-five-element-acupuncture/">Worsley Institute Training UK faculty</a>.</p>
							<p>For many years working in the Far East including Sydney and Canberra, Australia, I was registered with The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. Returning to Scotland in 2018, I am delighted to be able to offer this powerful therapy to others from the vibrant multi-disciplinary clinic, Balance in Glasgow&apos;s Westend.

							<h2>FAQs</h2>
							<h3>What is the cost of treatment?</h3>
							<p>Consultation &amp; treatment &pound;75.00 (2 hours)<br>Follow up treatment &pound;50.00 (1 hour)</p>
							<h3>How many treatment sessions might I need?</h3>
							<p>Treatment begins at the end of the first consultation and typically I recommend a few weekly sessions depending on your need. As your health returns, the recommended interval &nbsp;between treatments is extended.&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>What does it feel like?</h3>
							<p>Acupuncture needles are very fine and seldom cause more than a moment&apos;s sensation that varies depending on the individual and the part of the body being treated.&nbsp;</p>
							<h3>Is it safe?</h3>
							<p>Sterilised disposable needles are used only once for each individual patient. &nbsp;The clinic has been approved and licensed by the local authority according to statutory requirements.</p>
							<h3>Is acupuncture for me?</h3>
							<p>This question is best answered by scheduling a 15 minute chat, free of charge or obligation. &nbsp;If you are interested in finding out more you can contact me directly at:</p>
